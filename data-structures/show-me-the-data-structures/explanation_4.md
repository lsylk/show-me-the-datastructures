## Reasoning Behind Decisions:
The problem was already implemented in the repo, which makes it difficult to do the problem fairly. 

## Time Efficiency:
O(n) - Where n is the number of groups + the number of users defined within all groups. Even though the function is iterative and the datastructure is recursive, the function is basically a iterative search through all the user names.

## Space Efficiency:
O(n)
