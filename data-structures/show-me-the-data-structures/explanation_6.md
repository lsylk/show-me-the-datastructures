## Union Function

### Reasoning Behind Decisions:
I learned about the __iter__ and __next__ interface for python which allowed me to convert lists to sets nicely.
Then everything becomes a matter of implicitly iterating through the list which is O(n)

### Time Efficiency:
O(n)
### Space Efficiency:
O(n)


## Intersection Function

### Reasoning Behind Decisions:
The same reasoning as above, but now using the intersection set method

### Time Efficiency:
O(n)
### Space Efficiency:
O(n)
